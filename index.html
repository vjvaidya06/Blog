        <h2>Why Cybersecurity?</h2>
        <h5>10/24/2023</h5>
        <h5>A short memoir on how I discovered my love for Cybersecurity</h5>
        <p>In high school, I’ve developed a love of cybersecurity. After taking the Cybersecurity Honors course at EBHS, I took a course from SANS, got the GFACT security certification, and published a research paper at an IEEE international conference. Without realizing it, I have spent a whole lot of time in this area, which surprised me and made me think - Why? Why do I care about Cybersecurity and what draws me to it? Is it because there are a ton of high paying jobs or that it has the potential for a good career or because it is of critical importance to us all? While all of these are true, that is not my reason. I thought quite a bit about this, and since it is October, the Cybersecurity Awareness Month, I am sharing my thoughts in the hope that they may resonate with other teens. We really do need lots of cybersecurity practitioners in the field!</p>
        <p>So why cybersecurity? Because it really engages my gamer mindset. To me, cybersecurity is like crafting a shield to withstand a flurry of swords, or forging a sword that can pierce any shield, which I find incredibly interesting. Why have I decided to dedicate my sword and shield to this field specifically? Because I want to defend others from digital monsters that want to steal their data. Because I want to embody that same type of monster and ruthlessly slash against shields to prove their durability. Because I want to investigate the wounds left behind to retrieve forensic evidence, and because the field is constantly evolving. I’ve often asked myself why this doesn’t get old, and the answer is simpler than I thought. You simply can’t be banal in cybersecurity, especially in offensive applications like penetration testing that force you to constantly be one step ahead of the defenders. The field is constantly evolving, and people on the red (offensive) and blue (defensive) teams continue to develop new techniques and technologies to defeat each other. You can’t slice through a more advanced new generation of shields with that same old sword from twenty years ago, because modern techniques and technologies would be incomprehensible to the security practitioners of the past.</p>
        <p>Along with that, cybersecurity works well in tandem with my other passion: software engineering. You can’t do anything cybersecurity related without at least a basic understanding of programming. Good software is an essential base of both the sword and the shield, and developers work tirelessly patching exploits and discovering new ones. From the red team’s side, outdated software or operating systems can help them gain easy backdoor access to computers and servers, or escalate privilege to the SYSTEM/root user (the highest level accounts that can execute any software). The blue team on the other hand can set up things like log servers to try and identify hackers, set up encryption, isolate compromised devices on a network, make sure passwords can’t be brute forced by testing password crackers, and more. In the right hands, software can discreetly attack systems like a hidden assassin, or embody a locked down military base that the assassin has no hope of infiltrating.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity is also a field of experimentation, and many great exploits are discovered by learning about and experimenting with different software. By exploring code and experimenting with the terminal, you can get computers and systems to do what you want. Along with that, you have to investigate the target system or network. Oftentimes you’ll be able to find a computer or piece of software that’s outdated or generally exploitable, and you have to do this kind of reconnaissance in silence, avoiding sending suspicious behavior to logging databases and just generally leaving behind evidence that can be traced back to you. I love this kind of investigation, and it’s a central part of discovering and patching vulnerabilities, both in software and people.</p>
        <p>So, why am I drawn to cybersecurity? Because I love tinkering. Because it promises to stay interesting no matter how experienced I become. Because it is a field full of people constantly working on advancing the knowledge of how to protect digital information and counteracting the people advancing attack methods like exploitation and privilege escalation. I love Cybersecurity because it is a riveting, eternal battle between two opposing sides constantly innovating by creating new weapons and techniques, and I seek to contribute my own mind to furthering that battlefield.</p>
        <p>If you are a tinkerer, an investigator, a curious or creative person, a gamer, a strategist, or anything in between, please explore cybersecurity, maybe you’ll awaken the same love for it that I did. In our digital age, we need many passionate and experienced security practitioners to help keep everyone safe. Cyberstart America is a great resource and introduces Cybersecurity through a game. I really encourage everyone to give it a try!</p>
